This is an idea I wanted to work on for a long time, and I finally realized it during my sophomore winter break.

It is a simple simulation of charged particles on the surface of a sphere. The idea is to solve for those pretty molecular geometries you see in chemistry with this simulation rather than doing things analytically.

I think the result is fun and interesting, hope you enjoy!
