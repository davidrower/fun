This is an idea I wanted to work on for a long time, but only found the motivation to realize it during my sophomore winter break.

It is a simple simulatino of charged particles on the surface of a sphere. The idea is to solve for those pretty geometries you see in chemistry with this simulation rather than doing thinsg analytically.

I think the result is fun and interesting, hope you enjoy!
