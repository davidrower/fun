# Image Processing and Reinforcement Learning

My first hackathon project. Great experience...although I didn't come in with a clear idea of what I wanted to do. I had an inspiration on the second day when showing my new friends UCSB's "labrynth." I wanted to train a reinforcement learning algorithm to walk through the labrynth without hitting any walls.

This idea seemed nice, but when my sleep-deprived self got to work on it, I missed the subtleties between a maze and a graph. The result: a bunch of code to transform a maze into a graph, and navigate the resulting graph via a Q-learning algorithm. Although my original idea wasn't realized, I think what I did was pretty cool in the end. Be aware, however, I would not call this my best work...sleep deprivation has its effects!
